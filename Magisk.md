# Magisk
yeah, it's possible with some bugs, but it's possible!

# setting things up
download files:
Magisk: https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk
Magisk Delta: https://huskydg.github.io/magisk-files/intro.html
(you can don't install magisk if you do not prefer themes)
open magisk delta
tap install
make sure in first step all flags are disabled
tap next
use last option (will delete good safety net( do launchers even had that?))
tap install
reopen emulator
(do the final steps if you want to use themed magisk manager)
install magisk
via delta magisk allow magisk (yeah) su access
DON'T UPDATE MAGISK AFTER INSTALLING, UPDATE ONLY MAGISK DELTA OR MAGISK FORCE YOU TO UPDATE MAGISK WHAT CAN'T BE DONE!
hide magisk delta
use themes, disable notification in magisk about granting su access

# done
